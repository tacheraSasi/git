Git v2.51 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features
------------------------

 * Userdiff patterns for the R language have been added.

 * Documentation for "git send-email" has been updated with a bit more
   credential helper and OAuth information.

 * "git cat-file --batch" learns to understand %(objectmode) atom to
   allow the caller to tell missing objects (due to repository
   corruption) and submodules (whose commit objects are OK to be
   missing) apart.

 * "git diff --no-index dirA dirB" can limit the comparison with
   pathspec at the end of the command line, just like normal "git
   diff".

 * "git subtree" (in contrib/) learned to grok GPG signing its commits.

 * "git whatchanged" that is longer to type than "git log --raw"
   which is its modern rough equivalent has outlived its usefulness
   more than 10 years ago.  Plan to deprecate and remove it.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.
--------------------------------------------------------------

 * "git pack-objects" learned to find delta bases from blobs at the
   same path, using the --path-walk API.

 * CodingGuidelines update.

 * Add settings for Solaris 10 & 11.

 * Meson-based build/test framework now understands TAP output
   generated by our tests.

 * "Do not explicitly initialize to zero" rule has been clarified in
   the CodingGuidelines document.

   (merge 468817bab2 pw/stash-p-pathspec-fixes later to maint).

   (merge 2cc27b3501 ag/send-email-edit-threading-fix later to maint).

   (merge abf94a283f sa/multi-mailmap-fix later to maint).

 * "git maintenance" lacked the care "git gc" had to avoid holding
   onto the repository lock for too long during packing refs, which
